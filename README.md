<h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
<p><br /> My goal was to develop my own app similar to Apple News using UIkit and Swift. This includes API integration, custom user interface development, image caching implementation, and additional features.</p>
<h3><strong> Technologies and frameworks:</strong></h3>
<p>Swift, UIKit, Foundation Framework, URLSession, Codable.</p>
<h3><strong> Conclusion:</strong></h3>
<p><br /> Overall, the code demonstrates API integration by making network requests to retrieve news articles from the NewsAPI service and decode the JSON responses into Swift objects.</p>
